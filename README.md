This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router v6 where the `useParams` hook returns `undefined` when used within deeply nested routes.  The provided solution illustrates how to correctly access parameters in such scenarios using techniques like route parameters inheritance or passing data down through props.  The example code focuses on a practical scenario of a user profile page where the user ID is unavailable in nested components. The solution includes detailed comments explaining the problem and the implemented solution to solve the issue.  This is a valuable resource for anyone working with nested routes and the `useParams` hook in React Router v6.
